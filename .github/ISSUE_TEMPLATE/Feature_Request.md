```hcl
Copy-paste your Terraform configurations here. Please **shrink HCL replicating the bug to minimum** 
without modules. It will help us to respond and replicate the problem quicker. It may also uncover
some HCL error while doing so.

For bigger configs you may use [Gist(s)](https://gist.github.com) or a service like Dropbox and
share a link to the ZIP file. For security, you can also encrypt the files using our GPG public key.
