# vcd\_nsxt\_security\_group

Provides a resource to manage NSX-T Security Group. Security groups are groups of data center group
networks to which distributed firewall rules apply. Grouping networks helps you to reduce the total
number of distributed firewall rules to be created. 

Supported in provider *v3.3+* and VCD 10.1+ with NSX-T backed VDCs.

## Specific usage notes

## Example Usage 1 (Security Group with member networks)

```hcl
resource "vcd_nsxt_security_group" "frontend-servers" {
  org  = "my-org"
  vdc  = "my-nsxt-vdc"

  # refering to a datasource for existing NSX-T Edge Gateway
  edge_gateway_id = data.vcd_nsxt_edgegateway.existing.id

  name = "frontend-servers"
  description = "Security group consisting of frontend servers"

  member_org_network_ids = [vcd_network_routed_v2.frontend.id]
}
```

## Example Usage 2 (Empty Security Group)
```hcl
resource "vcd_nsxt_security_group" "group1" {
  org  = "my-org"
  vdc  = "my-nsxt-vdc"

  # refering to a datasource for existing NSX-T Edge Gateway
  edge_gateway_id = data.vcd_nsxt_edgegateway.existing.id

  name = "precreated security group"
  description = "Members to be added later"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org` - (Optional) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful
  when connected as sysadmin working across different organisations.
* `vdc` - (Optional) The name of VDC to use, optional if defined at provider level.
* `name` - (Required) A unique name for Security Group
* `description` - (Optional) An optional description of the Security Group
* `edge_gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the edge gateway (NSX-T only). Can be looked up using
  `vcd_nsxt_edgegateway` datasource
* `member_org_network_ids` (Optional) A set of Org Network IDs

## Attribute Reference
* `member_vms` A set of member VMs (if exist). see [Member VMs](#member-vms) below for details.

<a id="member-vms"></a>
## Member VMs

Each member VM contains following attributes:

* `vm_id` - Member VM ID
* `vm_name` - Member VM name
* `vapp_id` - Parent vApp ID for member VM (empty for standalone VMs)
* `vapp_name` - Parent vApp Name for member VM (empty for standalone VMs)


## Importing

~> The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state.
It does not generate configuration. [More information.](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/)

An existing Security Group configuration can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource
via supplying the full dot separated path for your Security Group name. An example is
below:

[docs-import]: https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

```
terraform import vcd_nsxt_security_group.imported my-org.my-org-vdc.my-nsxt-edge-gateway.my-security-group-name
```

The above would import the `my-security-group-name` Security Group config settings that are defined
on NSX-T Edge Gateway `my-nsxt-edge-gateway` which is configured in organization named `my-org` and
VDC named `my-org-vdc`.
