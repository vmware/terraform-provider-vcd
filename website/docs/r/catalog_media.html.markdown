### A note about upload progress

Until version 3.5.0, the progress was optionally shown on the screen. Due to changes in the terraform tool, such operation
is no longer possible. The progress messages are thus written to the log file (`go-vcloud-director.log`) using a special
tag `[SCREEN]`. To see the progress at run time, users can run the command below in a separate terminal window while
`terraform apply` is working:

```
$ tail -f go-vcloud-director.log | grep '\[SCREEN\]'
```

## Importing

Supported in provider *v2.5+*

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing media item can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying its path.
The path for this resource is made of org-name.catalog-name.media-name
For example, using this structure, representing a media item that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcd_catalog_media" "tf-mymedia" {
  org     = "my-org"
  catalog = "my-catalog"
  name    = "my-media"
}
```

You can import such catalog media into terraform state using this command

```
terraform import vcd_catalog_media.tf-mymedia my-org.my-catalog.my-media
```

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After importing, if you run `terraform plan` you will see the rest of the values and modify the script accordingly for
further operations.
