# vcd\_vapp

Provides a vCloud Director vApp resource. This can be used to create, modify, and delete vApps.

## Example of vApp with 2 VMs

Example with more than one VM under a vApp.

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_direct" "direct-network" {
  name             = "net"
  external_network = "my-ext-net"
}

resource "vcd_vapp" "web" {
  name = "web"

  metadata = {
    CostAccount = "Marketing Department"
  }
}

resource "vcd_vapp_org_network" "direct-network" {
  vapp_name         = vcd_vapp.web.name
  org_network_name  = vcd_network_direct.direct-network.name
}

resource "vcd_vapp_vm" "web1" {
  vapp_name     = vcd_vapp.web.name
  name          = "web1"

  catalog_name  = "my-catalog"
  template_name = "photon-os"

  memory        = 2048
  cpus          = 1

  network {
    type               = "org"
    name               = vcd_vapp_org_network.direct-network.org_network_name
    ip_allocation_mode = "POOL"
  }

  guest_properties = {
    "vapp.property1"   = "value1"
    "vapp.property2"   = "value2"
  }
}

resource "vcd_vapp_vm" "web2" {
  vapp_name     = vcd_vapp.web.name
  name          = "web2"

  catalog_name  = "my-catalog"
  template_name = "photon-os"

  memory        = 2048
  cpus          = 1

  network {
    type               = "org"
    name               = vcd_vapp_org_network.direct-network.org_network_name
    ip_allocation_mode = "POOL"
  }
}
```

## Example of Empty vApp with no VMs

```hcl
resource "vcd_vapp" "web" {
  name = "web"

  metadata = {
    boss = "Why is this vApp empty?"
    john = "I don't really know. Maybe somebody did forget to clean it up."
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the vApp
* `org` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful when connected as sysadmin working across different organisations
* `vdc` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) The name of VDC to use, optional if defined at provider level
* `description` (Optional; *v3.3*) An optional description for the vApp, up to 256 characters.
* `power_on` - (Optional) A boolean value stating if this vApp should be powered on. Default is `false`. Works only on update when vApp already has VMs.
* `metadata` - (Optional) Key value map of metadata to assign to this vApp. Key and value can be any string. (Since *v2.2+* metadata is added directly to vApp instead of first VM in vApp)
* `guest_properties` - (Optional; *v2.5+*) Key value map of vApp guest properties

* `href` - (Computed) The vApp Hyper Reference
* `status` - (Computed; *v2.5+*) The vApp status as a numeric code
* `status_text` - (Computed; *v2.5+*) The vApp status as text.


## Importing

Supported in provider *v2.5+*

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing vApp can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying its path.
The path for this resource is made of org-name.vdc-name.vapp-name
For example, using this structure, representing a vApp that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcd_vapp" "tf-vapp" {
  name              = "my-vapp"
  org               = "my-org"
  vdc               = "my-vdc"
}
```

You can import such vapp into terraform state using this command

```
terraform import vcd_vapp.tf-vapp my-org.my-vdc.my-vapp
```

NOTE: the default separator (.) can be changed using Provider.import_separator or variable VCD_IMPORT_SEPARATOR

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After importing, if you run `terraform plan` you will see the rest of the values and modify the script accordingly for
further operations.
