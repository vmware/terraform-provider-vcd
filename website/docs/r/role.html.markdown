## Example Usage

  name        = "new-role"
  description = "new role from CLI"

  ]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org` - (Optional) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful when connected as sysadmin working across different organisations
* `name` - (Required) The name of the role.
* `description` - (Required) A description of the role
* `rights` - (Optional) List of rights assigned to this role

## Attribute Reference

* `read_only` - Whether this role is read-only

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing role can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying the full dot separated path for a role.
For example, using this structure, representing an existing role that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl

resource "vcd_role" "catalog-author" {
  org  = "my-org"
  name = "Catalog Author"
}
```

You can import such role into terraform state using this command

```
terraform import vcd_role.catalog-author "my-org.Catalog Author"
```

NOTE: the default separator (.) can be changed using Provider.import_separator or variable VCD_IMPORT_SEPARATOR

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After that, you can expand the configuration file and either update or delete the role as needed. Running `terraform plan`
at this stage will show the difference between the minimal configuration file and the role's stored properties.

rights work together.
