# vcd\_lb\_virtual\_server

Provides a vCloud Director edge gateway load balancer virtual server data source. Adds an edge gateway
internal or uplink interface as a virtual server. A virtual server has a public IP address and services all incoming client requests. 

~> **Note:** To make load balancing work one must ensure that load balancing is enabled on edge gateway (edge gateway must be advanced).
This depends on NSX version to work properly. Please refer to [VMware Product Interoperability Matrices](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php#interop&29=&93=) 
to check supported vCloud director and NSX for vSphere configurations.

~> **Note:** The vCloud Director API for NSX supports a subset of the operations and objects defined in the NSX vSphere 
API Guide. The API supports NSX 6.2, 6.3, and 6.4.

Supported in provider *v2.4+*
